In the field of education, student outcomes vary significantly, with some individuals successfully completing their degree programs while others drop 
out before graduation. To better understand and predict academic performance, numerous datasets have been compiled that include variables such as student 
grades, employment status, and other relevant factors. This research aims to leverage machine learning (ML) models, along with advanced feature engineering 
techniques, to analyze these datasets and improve the accuracy of academic performance predictions. The analysis will encompass data from students across the 
United States and other countries worldwide.  

This research focuses on predicting student academic performance using machine learning models and feature engineering techniques. By analyzing diverse datasets
containing variables like grades and employment status, the study aims to identify patterns that influence educational outcomes globally, offering insights to 
improve student retention and success rates.
